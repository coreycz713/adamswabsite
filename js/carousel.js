Adam was professional and competent.  He completed the work with great skill and attention to detail.  He was courteous and ensured he understood our expectations exactly before he commenced work.  We could not be happier with the results!  We plan to use him for all our future remodeling and home repair needs. ~Bill">

Nailed it Renovations fixed an existing window that was leaking and had water damage and also repaired an entire wall and ceiling with new drywall/texture. The end result looked beautiful and we are beyond happy with their work!
                    It's always hard to find good, reliable contractors, and Adam was great at communication and went above and beyond to make sure the work was done right and up to our standards. I cannot recommend this company enough! ~Shannon">

He arrived promptly, communicated well and....he cleaned up his work area so nicely that I think it was cleaner than when he entered!  Most impressively, the frame I thought I needed made when I originally contacted him turned out not to be the frame I really needed.  Adam just rolled with it and I couldn't be happier with how it looks.  Awesome work! ~Sonja">

                    <img src="public/testomonials/richerd.png" alt="We recently purchased a home in Bremerton and had Adam do a bunch of odds and ends as well as a major master bath and upstairs level flooring renovation. 
                    Adam did amazing quality work and always responded to our messages quickly. He even would let us know daily when he was on his way to our place to start work. 
                    Not only did Adam do quality work, he directly told us his goal was to get the job done as soon as possible so we could get back to enjoying our new home. He was super considerate that we were displaced to sleeping in our downstairs living area while the project was underway, and completed the job as quickly as he could. 
                    Adam is not just a skilled contractor, but he is also a quality person. He especially won us over by how he cared for our pets as he worked. 
                    I can't say enough about Adam. We will always go to Adam for our future home projects. I don't think we could ever find anyone better. 
                    Thank you Adam for all your hard work in making our new home a happy and cozy home. ~Richerd">
