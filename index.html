                whatever life throws at your home from water damage, porch upgrades, or that "how did this even happen?"

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Nailed It Renovations is a contracting and subcontracting business. It was founded by Adam Kinnaman
                        roughly four years ago with a clear purpose: to build a dependable business that allowed flexibility
                        for family life while delivering quality workmanship to the local community.</p>
    
                    <p>Adam has spent much of his life working odd jobs after school and throughout his career, steadily
                        building practical, hands-on experience across a wide range of projects. Over time, those skills and
                        work ethic helped him establish a loyal and consistent clientele.</p>
    
                    <p>As the business grew, so did its reputation for reliability, adaptability, and honest craftsmanship.
                        Today, Nailed It Renovations serves the Kitsap, Washington area with a focus on quality renovations,
                        strong client relationships, and a balanced approach that supports both professional standards and
                        personal life.</p>
